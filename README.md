# Project 2: ANOVA – Ants on the Picnic Blanket

This project investigates which sandwich ingredients attract more ants using the Sandwich dataset.
We apply one-way and two-way ANOVA, assumption checks, and Tukey HSD post-hoc tests.

## 📌 Objectives
- Test whether bread type, topping, or butter affects ant attraction
- Check ANOVA assumptions (normality, homogeneity)
- Perform multiple comparisons (Tukey HSD)
- Analyze interactions between factors

## 🧠 Methods Used
- One-way ANOVA
- Two-way ANOVA
- Levene’s Test
- Shapiro–Wilk Test
- Tukey HSD
- R packages: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `car`

## 📈 Key Findings
- Bread type has no significant effect
- Topping is highly significant (ham & pickles attracts most ants)
- Butter significantly increases ant attraction
- No significant interactions between factors
